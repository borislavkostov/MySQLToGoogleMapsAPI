Most recently, his latest album Impressions won the Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Album at the 2013 55th Grammy Awards. Performing worldwide and selling more than four million albums, he has found a form of creative expression that begins in jazz and expands beyond the limits of any single genre.Over the past three decades, Botti has recorded and performed with the best in music, including Sting, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Lady Gaga, Josh Groban, Yo-Yo Ma, Michael Bubl, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, John Mayer, Andrea Bocelli, Joshua Bell, Aerosmith&#39;s Steven Tyler and even Frank Sinatra.

Playing with his uniquely expressive sound and soaring musical imagination, Botti is joined on the disc by featured artists Andrea Bocelli, Vince Gill, Herbie Hancock, Mark Knopfler, and David Foster in a warm, intimate celebration of melodic balladry.With Impressions and the albums that preceded it, Chris Botti has thoroughly established himself as one of the important, innovative figures of the contemporary music world.","modified":"2016-02-24 09:43:09","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"sunsetgirl4rich","linker":"evdb","name":"Chris Botti","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Chris-Botti?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000164330-6","short_bio":"Jazz"}},"title":"Chris Botti","venue_address":"801 Chase Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/627/857-8.jpeg_/chris-botti-57.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/627/857-8.jpeg_/chris-botti-57.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/627/857-8.jpeg_/chris-botti-57.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/627/857-8.jpeg_/chris-botti-57.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-02-24 09:43:09","venue_id":"V0-001-000261336-6","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts","venue_url":"http://baltimore.eventful.com/venues/maryland-hall-for-the-creative-arts-/V0-001-000261336-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"Europe/Brussels","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":null,"postal_code":"1210","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"50.8549224","groups":null,"url":"http://brussels.eventful.com/events/alani-/E0-001-091074573-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-091074573-3","privacy":"1","city_name":"Brussels","link_count":null,"longitude":"4.3653157","country_name":"Belgium","country_abbr":"BEL","region_name":null,"start_time":"2016-05-15 19:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":"Singer/songwriter ALA.NI, hailing from London, releases her debut EP ‘YOU & I: Spring’ via ParadYse / No Format Records today alongside the video for latest single ‘Ol’ Fashioned Kiss’.

Ethan has toured the world, connecting with diverse audiences in countries such as South Africa, Brazil, Canada and Australia. In 2011, he made history as the youngest entertainer to headline a show in Las Vegas. Ethan was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as The Worlds Youngest Solo Musician to Headline His Own Tour. When Ethan was five, his younger brother had three heart surgeries and that emotional time inspired him to use his musical talents to benefit charity. Since then Ethan Bortnick has helped raise over $30,000,000 for nonprofits around the world, sharing the stage with such legends as Elton John, Josh Groban, Andrea Bocelli, Beyonce, and Reba McEntire. His deep musical knowledge, broad tastes, and staggering talents make his performances a treat for the whole family.

Born in 1873, Caruso made close to 300 commercially released recordings, and his illustrious career paved the way for classical crossover stars like Luciano Pavarotti and Andrea Bocelli. But opera is meant for the stage, and nothing beats hearing the music live and in person. That&#39;s where acclaimed tenor Esposito comes in. With a repertoire that includes Italian and American standards, traditional Neapolitan arias, and even some original compositions, Esposito performs the songs that made Caruso famous, including &quot;La Donna e Mobile&quot; from Verdi&#39;s <em>Rigoletto</em> and more. He also leads a video tour of Naples and the Amalfi Coast via clips from his successful TV special.

Born in 1873, Caruso made close to 300 commercially released recordings (the bulk of which you can still get in stores or digitally), and his illustrious career paved the way for classical crossover stars like Luciano Pavarotti and Andrea Bocelli. But opera is meant for the stage, and nothing beats hearing the music live and in person. That&#39;s where Esposito comes in. With a repertoire that includes Italian and American standards, traditional Neapolitan arias, and even some original compositions, Esposito performs the songs that made Caruso famous, including &quot;La Donna e Mobile&quot; from Verdi&#39;s <em>Rigoletto</em>, one of his most renowned recordings.
